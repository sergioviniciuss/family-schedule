# Code Style Rules

- Do NOT add trailing empty lines at the end of files
- Files should end with a single newline character (if any)
- Do NOT add extra whitespace or empty lines unless necessary for readability
- Preserve existing formatting unless explicitly asked to reformat
- When making changes, only modify what's necessary - don't reformat unrelated code
